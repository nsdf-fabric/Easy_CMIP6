# Introduction



## The `NEX-GDDP-CMIP6` data 

The `NEX-GDDP-CMIP6` is a combination of historical data (from 1950 to 2014) and 
simulation data (from 2015 to 2100) generated as global climate scenarios derived 
(downscaled) from the General Circulation Models (GCM) runs defined in the 
Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) descussed in [@gmd-9-1937-2016].

The data is accessible in a set of `netcdf` files [@56302,@li2003parallelnetcdfscientifichighperformance,@Latham2010] each cointaining a year of data for a particular variable. 


## The streaming `OpenVisus` data abstraction
The examples in this book use the OpenVisus library, which implements the data streming technology presented in [@valerio-chapter2012;@7747805].
